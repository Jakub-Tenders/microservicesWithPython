# Module 6 — used when you add JWT validation to game-service.
# Nothing to implement here. Your task is to wire require_admin into the
# DELETE /v1/games/{id} endpoint in main.py as a FastAPI dependency.
#
# Before this file will work you need to add one setting to your config.py:
#
#   auth_secret_key: str = "dev-secret-change-in-production"
#
# It must match the SECRET_KEY in auth-service — that's how game-service can
# verify a token without ever calling auth-service.

    FastAPI dependency — verifies the JWT and asserts the caller has the admin role.

    Usage in main.py:
        from app.security import require_admin

        @app.delete("/v1/games/{game_id}", dependencies=[Depends(require_admin)])
        async def delete_game(game_id: str, ...):

    Returns the decoded token payload if valid and role == "admin".
    Raises 403 if the token is valid but the role is not admin.
    Raises 401 if the token is missing, expired, or tampered with.

    Note: 401 means "I don't know who you are".
          403 means "I know who you are, but you can't do this".
